## An Analysis of Google Places suggestions, abortion clinics, & county income level
#### by Sofia Kobayashi, December 2022
- For my final project in Wellesley's Data Visualization & Analysis course, I chose to look into how a person's geographic location when searching for abortion help affected the places that they were suggested by Google Places regarding the "quality" of those abortion clinic suggestions.
- I worked with a group of classmates to come up with the initial idea of analyzing Google Places data for abortion clinics, but once we had our starting points, we would individually seek to answer different questions surrounding this data.
- I found that when searching from counties with very low (\$ 30,000 - $60,000) or very high ($120,000 - $140,000) median household incomes, the top Google Places-suggestioned clinics consistently had high star ratings, while the clinics suggested to people search from counties with a median household income between \$60,000 - \$120,000 had star ratings that would vary wildly.
    - Additionally, the distance to the nearest suggested clinics would decrease as a county's median household income rose.
